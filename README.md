# Chunk-file-team-45

This platform was concieved to help people get a better hold of large data processing.
We discovered that in recent times, businesses and organizations have huge problems working on large files, especially the tabularized files,
hence the essence of this project.

Our team is a group of people that decides to contribute our own quota to the world by relieveing these businesses or organizations off their stress and 
overwhelming workload when it comes to data processing. 
A Solution to break files down into bits when the parent file is too large and overwhelming for its users.

This platform accepts file from users and help them split it into meaningful bits.
The user gets back the original content of the uploaded file but in chunked pieces with better usability and less overwhelming.

We named it iOTA

Currently, iOTA has been designed to accept two file formats which are .csv and .json, there
will be more improvement as time goes on to accept other file formats.


iOTA will accomodate two major types of users, The Authenticated and Non-Authenticated.
The unauthenticated user can only visit and interact with the pheripheral parts of the platform, but can't perform any 
major task, such as spliting or chuncking.
However, the authenticated(logged in)user can perform all the actions allowed on the platform.

Some of the platform features includes:
Dedicated File Storage
SPliting of Files
Sharing Downloadable links
Choosing Split parameters and lots more

More mindblowing features are comming soon, Watchout for iOTA.
